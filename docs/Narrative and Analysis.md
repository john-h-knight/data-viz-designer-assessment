**Narrative**

Over the past 50 years, employment levels in both rural and nonrural areas increased at dramatically different rates. In 2022, nonrural employment reached almost 250% of 1969 levels while rural employment rose to only 166% of 1969 levels (see Figure 2). The different trajectories originate around 1980 with the emergence of the knowledge economy, which disproportionately benefitted nonrural communities. Employment levels dropped noticeably for both areas during the Great Recession. However, nonrural employment recovered much faster than rural employment, which was relatively flat throughout the 2010s. This period of time is the biggest contributor to the gap in employment levels for rural and nonrural areas.

A big driver of the growing employment divide is attributed to the difference in employment levels in the tradable services sector (see Figure 7). This sector includes businesses like SaaS, consulting, IT services, and digital marketing. In 2022, nonrural employment levels in tradable services were nearly double that of rural areas, 30% and 17%, respectively. While rural areas have a higher proportion of employment levels in the tradable goods (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing) than nonrural areas, this sector has been acutely affected by globalization and automation.

**Analysis**

For the figure 2 makeover I chose to stick with the line chart because it effectively visualizes how the gap between rural and nonrural employment has grown dramatically over time. However, I made some design changes to better reinforce that point. The area between the lines is filled in to visually define it as something more than negative space. I used the same dark purple as the nonrural line for the area, albeit more transparent, to show that the gap represents higher relative employment levels for nonrural areas. Based on the shape of the data, I moved the y-axis labels to the right side of the chart so that is easier to evaluate the most recent values. I also decided to use a black line for the x-axis and move the tick marks up to anchor it visually for the rest of the chart. 

The figure 7 makeover is a larger departure from the original chart. Based on the narrative I believe it’s more important that the chart clearly visualize the difference between tradable services, instead of how the sectors have changed over time. A dumbbell chart using the most recent year (2022) makes the difference between rural and nonrural employment in tradable services immediately clear. It’s the first category when reading from top-down and the points are directly labeled vice using a legend. The points are slightly transparent to accommodate the fact that the local services points are on top of each other.
